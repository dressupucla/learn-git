## Exercise: Add particpant profile to the DResSUP website

* The Task: DResSUP participants will add their own profiles to the [DResSUP website](http://dressup.library.ucla.edu/participants/). 
* The Goal: Introduce participants to Git, GitHub, and Jekyll (a static site generator).

Notes:
* We will be doing "pair programming," meaning two people will work together on a single computer - Macs only today!

#### Getting your own copy of the DResSUP website

First, you'll need to get your own local copy of the website so that you can edit and preview your work:

1. Login to GitHub (https://github.com) 
2. Navigate to the DResSUP website repository (https://github.com/dressupucla/dressupucla.github.io)
3. Fork the repository
  * In the top right corner, there is a **Fork** button - just click it
  * "Forking" copies the repository from one account to another (in this case, from the DResSUP account into your own account). You should see an animation that the repo is being copied
  * Let's explore the repo a bit... (files and file structure, Settings and GitHub Pages, viewing the live site)
  
#### Cloning your repo to your local machine

Next, we'll need to clone our forked repo to our local machines:

1. Open Terminal
2. Change your working directory to the Desktop
3. Clone the forked repo: git clone [url]
4. Move into the newly cloned directory
5. `bundle install`
6. Start the Jekyll server: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
7. In browser, navigate to http://localhost:4000

#### Add your own profiles to the site

1. Look at the files in the newly cloned `dressupucla.github.io` folder
2. 

#### Push your changes to your remote repo on GitHub

#### Merge your changes into the main DResSUP site
